    "## Generating Free Verse with Markovify\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen in a previous notebook how to generate sentences using [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) and an entire novel(!!) using [markov-novel](https://github.com/accraze/python-markov-novel). In this short notebook, I'll show you how to adapt markovify in order to also generate free verse. \n",
    "\n",
    "To work with this notebook locally on your own machine in your own Jupyter environment, you'll need to download this .ipynb file, as well as both .txt files (\"moon_poetry.txt\" and \"sea_poetry.txt\"). You'll also need to install markovify if you haven't already. \n",
    "\n",
    "One potential way to make markov-generated poetry more semantically coherent is to build the model on top of a thematic corpus, which is to say a corpus of poems all devoted to a similar subject, such as love, nature, illness, war, peace, etc. I've started a \"Datasets\" Page on our Elms site that includes a link to the [Kaggle poetry dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/michaelarman/poemsdataset). This dataset, which has been released into the public domain, is organized by poetic type and theme. I've consolidated all the lunar poems into a single file to make it easy to work with them, and done the same for the nautical poems. \n",
